      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>After cleaning the data and creating our visualizations, we have reached a couple key takeaways from this project.  Firstly on the Academic Insights slide, a student's environment seemed to be one of the most important factors in their success.  Based on our visualizations, both family involvement along with the safety score of the school were large factors in a student's performance.  This demonstrates how environmental factors like these can be just as important to a student's learning as the teacher quality.  Secondly from the Misconduct Insights, we learned that student attendance seems to be negatively related with instances of misconduct and suspension along with the fact that schools with more suspensions have lower graduation rates.  Based on this, it is clear that Chicago schools should try to improve attendance because the data shows its negative effect on misconduct, which will improve graduation rates as a result.  Next, from the School Level Insights, we saw that attendance was similar across elementary, middle, and high schools despite performance differing.  In addition to this, the college enrollment percentage is positively correlated with the average ACT score of the school, showing how important standardized testing is to enrolling in college.  Finally, from our Location Insights page, we noticed the large disparity between schools to the North of Chicago and those to the South of Chicago.  Northern schools tended to have higher attendance, performance, and ambitious instruction scores than those to the South.  Because of this, the Chicago Public School system should likely allocate more funds to schools to the South of the city in order to help improve performance, attendance, and instruction.</p>
